- **Minimalist UI**: The app should have a simple and clean UI. All UI elements except the play button should be invisible by default. The other UI elements should fade in when the user interacts with the app and fade out after a short period of inactivity.
- **GitHub Issues**: When the user mentions an issue, use the github cli to find the issue reference on github.
